### Category Precedence Rules (Updated with Paid Programming)

#### 1. Direct Response (8.7% - Highest Priority)
**Definition:** All WorldLink agency advertising  
**Precedence:** Takes priority over all other categories
**Implementation:** `DirectResponseQueryBuilder`

#### 2. Paid Programming (2.8% - NEW HIGH PRIORITY)
**Definition:** All spots with `revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'`  
**Precedence:** Second priority - revenue_type classification trumps bill_code patterns
**Implementation:** `PaidProgrammingQueryBuilder`

**Key Insight:** This category captures:
- **McHale Media:Kingdom of God**: Religious programming ($28,600)
- **NKB:Shop LC**: Shopping content ($66,700) - *formerly Overnight Shopping*
- **Fujisankei**: Japanese programming ($19,679)
- **Other paid programming**: Various content ($1,428)

**Business Rule:** `revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'` is more definitive than bill_code pattern matching

#### 3. Branded Content (PRD) (1.3%)
**Definition:** Internal production spots (spot_type = 'PRD')  
**Precedence:** Third priority for spots without language assignment
**Implementation:** `BrandedContentQueryBuilder`

#### 4. Services (SVC) (0.3%)
**Definition:** Station service spots (spot_type = 'SVC')  
**Precedence:** Fourth priority for spots without language assignment
**Implementation:** `ServicesQueryBuilder`

#### 5. Individual Language Blocks (78.4%)
**Definition:** Single language targeting for community engagement  
**Precedence:** Fifth priority, includes all individually assigned language spots
**Implementation:** `IndividualLanguageQueryBuilder`

#### 6. Roadblocks (5.7%)
**Definition:** Broadcast sponsorships with campaign_type = 'roadblock'  
**Precedence:** Sixth priority for spots with roadblock campaign classification
**Implementation:** `RoadblocksQueryBuilder`

#### 7. Multi-Language Cross-Audience (1.0%)
**Definition:** Cross-cultural advertising spanning multiple language blocks  
**Precedence:** Seventh priority for remaining multi-language spots
**Implementation:** `MultiLanguageQueryBuilder`

**Updated Exclusions:**
- Excludes `revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'` (now handled by category 2)
- Excludes roadblocks (handled by category 6)
- Excludes WorldLink (handled by category 1)

#### 8. Other Non-Language (1.8%)
**Definition:** All remaining spots (catch-all category)  
**Precedence:** Lowest priority, captures everything else
**Implementation:** Automatic assignment of remaining spots

## üé¨ Paid Programming Category (NEW)

- **Total Spots**: 264 spots (all paid, 0% BNS)
- **Average per Spot**: $438.67
- **Key Principle**: Revenue type classification over bill code patterns

### Customer Breakdown
Based on actual revenue_type = 'Paid Programming' data:

1. **NKB:Shop LC**: $66,700 (66 spots) - Shopping programming
2. **McHale Media:Kingdom of God**: $28,600 (104 spots) - Religious content  
3. **Fujisankei**: $19,679 (82 spots) - Japanese programming
4. **Desert Media Partners**: $429 (8 spots) - Regional content
5. **Cornerstone Media Group**: $400 (4 spots) - Media services

### Business Intelligence
- **No BNS Content**: All Paid Programming spots generate revenue (unlike roadblocks)
- **Diverse Content**: Shopping, religious, ethnic, and regional programming
- **Premium Rates**: $438.67 average per spot vs. $34.71 overall average
- **Formerly Misclassified**: NKB:Shop LC previously in "Overnight Shopping"

### Technical Implementation
```python
def _get_paid_programming_spot_ids(self, year_suffix: str) -> Set[int]:
    """Get Paid Programming spot IDs (all revenue_type = 'Paid Programming')"""
    query = """
    SELECT DISTINCT s.spot_id
    FROM spots s
    WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE ?
    AND (s.revenue_type != 'Trade' OR s.revenue_type IS NULL)
    AND (s.gross_rate IS NOT NULL OR s.station_net IS NOT NULL OR s.spot_type = 'BNS')
    AND s.revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'
    """
    
    cursor = self.db_connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query, [f"%-{year_suffix}"])
    return set(row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall())
```

## üìú Major Changes from Previous Version

### ‚ùå Overnight Shopping Category Removed
**Reason**: NKB:Shop LC spots have `revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'`  
**Impact**: $66,700 revenue moved to Paid Programming category  
**Business Logic**: Revenue type is more authoritative than bill code patterns

**Before:**
```
Overnight Shopping: $66,700 (66 spots) - NKB pattern matching
```

**After:**
```
Paid Programming: $115,808.12 (264 spots) - revenue_type classification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NKB:Shop LC: $66,700 (66 spots)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ McHale Media: $28,600 (104 spots)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Others: $20,508 (94 spots)
```

### üéØ Multi-Language Export Script Updated
The export script now properly excludes Paid Programming spots:

```bash
# Updated export with Paid Programming exclusion
./export_multilang.sh -y 2024 -c  # Core fields only
./export_multilang.sh -y 2024 -o custom_export.csv  # Full export
```

**New Exclusion Logic:**
```sql
AND s.revenue_type != 'Paid Programming'  -- NEW: Excludes all paid programming
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Updated Multi-Language Analysis
```bash
# Export multi-language spots (excluding Paid Programming)
./export_multilang.sh -y 2024

# Show weekday vs weekend breakdown
./export_multilang.sh -y 2024 | tail -n +2 | cut -d, -f6 | sort | uniq -c
```

### Paid Programming Analysis
```sql
-- Get all Paid Programming customers for 2024
SELECT 
    s.bill_code,
    COUNT(*) as spots,
    SUM(s.gross_rate) as revenue,
    AVG(s.gross_rate) as avg_rate
FROM spots s
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-24'
AND s.revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'
GROUP BY s.bill_code
ORDER BY SUM(s.gross_rate) DESC;
```

### Perfect Reconciliation Validation
```bash
# Verify perfect reconciliation
python src/unified_analysis.py --year 2024 | grep "Perfect Reconciliation"
# Should show: Perfect Reconciliation: ‚úÖ YES
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Paid Programming Category Issues

#### "McHale Media still appears in Multi-Language"
**Problem**: Multi-Language query not excluding Paid Programming spots  
**Solution**: Ensure `AND s.revenue_type != 'Paid Programming'` in multi-language logic

#### "Reconciliation shows $115,808 difference"
**Problem**: Base query excluding Paid Programming but categories including them  
**Solution**: Remove Paid Programming exclusion from base query to include all spots

#### "Overnight Shopping category still shows $66,700"
**Problem**: NKB spots captured by Overnight Shopping instead of Paid Programming  
**Solution**: Move Paid Programming to higher precedence (position 2)

### Export Script Issues

#### "McHale Media appears in multi-language export"
**Problem**: Export script not excluding Paid Programming  
**Solution**: Update export query to include `AND s.revenue_type != 'Paid Programming'`

## üß† Critical Lessons Learned

### 12. Revenue Type Trumps Bill Code Patterns (NEW)
**Challenge**: NKB:Shop LC was misclassified as "Overnight Shopping" based on bill code  
**Solution**: Prioritize `revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'` over bill code pattern matching
**Impact**: $66,700 properly reclassified, category removed

**Key Insight:** Database fields with structured values (revenue_type) are more reliable than pattern matching on free-text fields (bill_code).

### 13. Precedence Order Matters for Perfect Reconciliation (NEW)
**Challenge**: Paid Programming spots captured by multiple categories causing double-counting  
**Solution**: Move Paid Programming to position 2 (high precedence) and subtract from remaining spots
**Impact**: Perfect reconciliation achieved

**Technical Detail:**
```python
# CRITICAL: Must subtract spots from remaining pool
paid_programming_spots = self._get_paid_programming_spot_ids(year_suffix) & remaining_spots
categories.append(self._create_category_result("Paid Programming", paid_programming_spots, year_suffix))
remaining_spots -= paid_programming_spots  # ‚Üê ESSENTIAL for perfect reconciliation
```

### 14. Simplification Through Elimination (NEW)
**Challenge**: Overnight Shopping category had $0.00 after proper Paid Programming classification  
**Solution**: Remove unnecessary categories to simplify business logic
**Impact**: Cleaner system with fewer edge cases

**Business Value:**
- **Reduced Complexity**: 8 categories instead of 9
- **Clearer Logic**: No empty categories to explain
- **Better Understanding**: Revenue type classification over pattern matching

### 15. Export Script Maintenance (NEW)
**Challenge**: Export scripts need updates when category logic changes  
**Solution**: Maintain export script exclusion logic alongside category changes
**Impact**: Consistent data exports that align with category analysis

## üìä Report Generation

### Updated Analysis Commands
