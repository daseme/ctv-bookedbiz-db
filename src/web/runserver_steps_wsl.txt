ystemd Service Overview
What it is: systemd is Linux's service manager that handles starting/stopping background processes and ensuring they run persistently.
Your setup:

Service name: flaskapp.service
Location: /etc/systemd/system/flaskapp.service
What it runs: /opt/apps/ctv-bookedbiz-db/runserver.sh (which then starts uvicorn)

Key commands

# Check if service starts on boot
sudo systemctl is-enabled flaskapp

# Start the service now
sudo systemctl start flaskapp

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop flaskapp

# Enable to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable flaskapp

# Disable from starting on boot
sudo systemctl disable flaskapp

# Check current status
sudo systemctl status flaskapp

# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u flaskapp -f

# Restart service (useful after code changes)
sudo systemctl restart flaskapp

How it works:

Boot time: systemd automatically starts flaskapp.service because it's "enabled"
Runs persistently: The service runs independently of your SSH/WSL session
Auto-restart: If the process crashes, systemd can restart it (depending on configuration)
Logging: All output goes to systemd logs (viewable with journalctl)

Key benefit: Your Flask app now runs as a proper system service that survives reboots and doesn't depend on keeping terminal sessions open!
