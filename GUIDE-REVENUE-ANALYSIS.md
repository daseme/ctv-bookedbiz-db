## 🏆 **Category Precedence Rules**

### **1. Direct Response (8.7% - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
**Definition:** All WorldLink agency advertising  
**Business Rule:** Must be evaluated FIRST before any other assignment logic  
**Revenue Impact:** Prevents ~$387K from being miscategorized

```sql
-- Direct Response Extraction Query
SELECT DISTINCT s.spot_id
FROM spots s
LEFT JOIN agencies a ON s.agency_id = a.agency_id
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-24'
AND (s.revenue_type != 'Trade' OR s.revenue_type IS NULL)
AND (s.gross_rate IS NOT NULL OR s.station_net IS NOT NULL OR s.spot_type = 'BNS')
AND COALESCE(a.agency_name, '') NOT LIKE '%WorldLink%'
AND COALESCE(s.bill_code, '') NOT LIKE '%WorldLink%'
AND s.revenue_type != 'Paid Programming'
AND ((a.agency_name LIKE '%WorldLink%' AND s.gross_rate > 0)
     OR (s.bill_code LIKE '%WorldLink%' AND s.gross_rate > 0)
     OR (s.revenue_type = 'Direct Response' AND s.gross_rate > 0))
```

### **2. Paid Programming (2.8% - NEW HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Definition:** All spots with `revenue_type = 'Paid Programming'`  
**Business Rule:** Revenue type classification trumps bill code patterns

## 🔄 **Major Changes from Previous Version**

### **✅ Campaign Type Classification (FIXED)**
**Change:** Updated to use `campaign_type` field instead of legacy logic  
**Impact:** More accurate Individual Language and ROSs categorization  
**Business Logic:** Structured field classification over complex span analysis

**Before:**
```sql
-- Individual Language: spans_multiple_blocks = 0 AND block_id IS NOT NULL
-- ROSs: business_rule_applied IN ('ros_duration', 'ros_time')
```

**After:**
```sql
-- Individual Language: campaign_type = 'language_specific'
-- ROSs: campaign_type = 'ros'
```

### **📦 Packages Category Added (NEW)**
**Change:** Added dedicated category for package deals without time targeting  
**Impact:** Better tracking of bundled advertising deals  
**Business Logic:** PKG spots without specific time targeting

**Classification:**
```sql
-- Packages: spot_type = 'PKG' AND campaign_type IS NULL
```

### **🎯 Other Non-Language Reduction**
**Change:** Proper classification reduces Other Non-Language to <1% of spots  
**Impact:** More accurate revenue categorization  
**Business Logic:** Fixed classification logic captures more spots in appropriate categories

**Expected Results:**
- **Individual Language:** 65-75% of revenue (improved from previous)
- **Other Non-Language:** <1% of revenue (reduced from 5-7%)
- **Total Categories:** 9 categories with perfect reconciliation

AND (s.revenue_type != 'Trade' OR s.revenue_type IS NULL)
AND (s.gross_rate IS NOT NULL OR s.station_net IS NOT NULL OR s.spot_type = 'BNS');
```

### **Category Validation**
```sql
-- Verify Perfect Reconciliation (9 Categories)
WITH category_totals AS (
    SELECT 'Direct Response' as category, SUM(gross_rate) as revenue FROM spots WHERE [direct_response_logic]
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Paid Programming' as category, SUM(gross_rate) as revenue FROM spots WHERE [paid_programming_logic]
    UNION ALL

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Classification Issues**

#### **"Other Non-Language category is unexpectedly large"**
**Problem:** Classification logic using legacy fields instead of campaign_type  
**Solution:** Verify campaign_type field population and update classification logic

```sql
-- Check campaign_type field population
SELECT 
    campaign_type,
    COUNT(*) as spots,
    SUM(s.gross_rate) as revenue
FROM spots s
JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-YY'
GROUP BY campaign_type
ORDER BY spots DESC;

-- Look for missing campaign_type
SELECT COUNT(*) as missing_campaign_type
FROM spots s
LEFT JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-YY' 
AND slb.campaign_type IS NULL;
```

#### **"Individual Language percentage is too low"**
**Problem:** Using old spans_multiple_blocks logic instead of campaign_type  
**Solution:** Update query to use `campaign_type = 'language_specific'`

```sql
-- Verify Individual Language classification
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as language_specific_spots,
    SUM(s.gross_rate) as revenue
FROM spots s
JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-YY'
AND slb.campaign_type = 'language_specific';
```

#### **"ROSs not being captured correctly"**
**Problem:** Using business_rule_applied instead of campaign_type  
**Solution:** Update query to use `campaign_type = 'ros'`

```sql
-- Verify ROSs classification
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as ros_spots,
    SUM(s.gross_rate) as revenue
FROM spots s
JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-YY'
AND slb.campaign_type = 'ros';
```

### **Packages Category Issues**

#### **"Packages category is empty"**
**Problem:** PKG spots being captured by other categories  
**Solution:** Verify packages query excludes spots with campaign_type assignments

```sql
-- Check PKG spots without campaign_type
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as package_candidates,
    SUM(s.gross_rate) as revenue
FROM spots s
LEFT JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-YY'
AND s.spot_type = 'PKG'
AND slb.campaign_type IS NULL;
```

#### **"Packages revenue seems too high"**
**Problem:** Non-PKG spots being classified as packages  
**Solution:** Verify packages query requires spot_type = 'PKG'

### **Export Script Issues**

#### **"Export totals don't match category analysis"**
**Problem:** Export script using old classification logic  
**Solution:** Update export queries to use campaign_type fields

```bash
# Update export script classification logic
# FROM: spans_multiple_blocks = 0 AND block_id IS NOT NULL
# TO: campaign_type = 'language_specific'
```

### **Reconciliation Issues**

#### **"Perfect reconciliation shows errors"**
**Problem:** Spots assigned to multiple categories or missing from all categories  
**Solution:** Verify mutual exclusion using updated precedence rules

```sql
-- Check for spots missing from all categories
SELECT s.spot_id, s.bill_code, s.spot_type, slb.campaign_type
FROM spots s
LEFT JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE s.broadcast_month LIKE '%-YY'
AND s.spot_id NOT IN (
    SELECT spot_id FROM [all_category_unions]
);
```
