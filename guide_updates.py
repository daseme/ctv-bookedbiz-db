- **Paid Spots**: 3,025 spots generating revenue
- **Average per Spot**: $25.21 (including BNS spots)

### Full Day Roadblock Classification
Based on actual time patterns found in the data:

- **6:00:00 to 23:59:00**: Full Day Roadblock (6:00am-11:59pm) - Main pattern
- **6:00:00 to 23:00:00**: Full Day Roadblock (6:00am-11:00pm) - Ends at 11pm

### Technical Implementation
```python
from src.roadblocks_analyzer import RoadblocksAnalyzer, RoadblocksReportGenerator

# Analyze roadblocks
with sqlite3.connect("data/database/production.db") as db:
    analyzer = RoadblocksAnalyzer(db)
    
    # Get summary
    summary = analyzer.get_summary("2024")
    print(f"Roadblocks: {{summary.total_spots:,}} spots, ${{summary.total_revenue:,.2f}}")
    print(f"BNS Rate: {{summary.bns_percentage:.1f}}%")
    
    # Get time patterns
    patterns = analyzer.get_time_patterns("2024")
    for pattern in patterns:
        print(f"{{pattern.classification}}: {{pattern.spots:,}} spots")
    
    # Generate report
    report_gen = RoadblocksReportGenerator(db)
    report = report_gen.generate_report("2024")
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Roadblocks-Only Analysis
```python
from src.roadblocks_analyzer import RoadblocksAnalyzer

# Detailed roadblocks analysis
with sqlite3.connect("data/database/production.db") as db:
    analyzer = RoadblocksAnalyzer(db)
    
    # Summary statistics
    summary = analyzer.get_summary("2024")
    print(f"Total Spots: {{summary.total_spots:,}}")
    print(f"BNS Rate: {{summary.bns_percentage:.1f}}%")
    print(f"Revenue: ${{summary.total_revenue:,.2f}}")
    
    # Time patterns
    patterns = analyzer.get_time_patterns("2024")
    for pattern in patterns:
        print(f"{{pattern.time_range}}: {{pattern.classification}}")
    
    # Customer analysis
    customers = analyzer.get_customers("2024")
    for customer in customers[:5]:
        print(f"{{customer.customer_name}}: {{customer.total_spots:,}} spots")
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Roadblocks analysis
python src/roadblocks_analyzer.py --year 2024 --output roadblocks_2024.md

# Summary only
python src/roadblocks_analyzer.py --year 2024 --summary-only
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Roadblocks Category Issues

#### "No roadblocks found"
**Problem**: campaign_type = 'roadblock' not found in spot_language_blocks table  
**Solution**: Verify campaign_type values and roadblock assignment logic

#### "High BNS percentage unexpected"
**Problem**: 67% BNS rate seems unusual  
**Solution**: This is expected for roadblocks - they're often public service content

#### "roadblocks_analyzer module not found"
**Problem**: Integration layer can't find roadblocks_analyzer module  
**Solution**: Verify module is in src/ directory and import path is correct

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la src/roadblocks_analyzer.py

# Test import
python -c "from src.roadblocks_analyzer import RoadblocksAnalyzer; print('Import successful')"
```

## 🧠 Critical Lessons Learned

### 9. Roadblocks Category Integration (NEW)
**Challenge**: Broadcast sponsorships were mixed with other categories  
**Solution**: Added dedicated roadblocks category with proper BNS tracking
**Impact**: $232,388.01 revenue properly categorized with 67% BNS rate identified

**Key Insights:**
- **BNS Dominance**: 67% of roadblocks are bonus spots (public service nature)
- **Full Day Coverage**: 18-hour roadblocks (6:00am-11:59pm) are the norm
- **Customer Profile**: Government/non-profit focus (Future Forward, Cal Fire, etc.)
- **Revenue Impact**: Significant revenue stream ($232K) previously mixed with other categories

### 10. Separation of Concerns Architecture (NEW)
**Challenge**: Monolithic unified_analysis.py was becoming unwieldy  
**Solution**: Modular architecture with dedicated roadblocks_analyzer.py
**Impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with testable components

**Benefits:**
- **Maintainability**: Each module has single responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently
- **Extensibility**: New categories can be added easily
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different analyses

### 11. BNS Tracking Enhancement (NEW)
**Challenge**: BNS spots were not clearly distinguished from paid spots  
**Solution**: Comprehensive BNS tracking across all categories
**Impact**: Clear understanding of bonus content distribution

**Business Value:**
- **Inventory Management**: Understanding of paid vs. bonus inventory
- **Customer Relationships**: BNS spots indicate public service commitments
- **Revenue Optimization**: Focus paid efforts on revenue-generating categories
- **Public Service Tracking**: Clear measurement of community service content
