## üìä **SQL Queries for Your HTML Team**

The `language_block_reporting_queries.sql` artifact contains production-ready SQL queries with these parameters:

### **Core Revenue Report**
```sql
-- Replace these parameters:
:start_date = '2025-01-01'
:end_date = '2025-01-31'  
:language_code = 'M'  -- Optional: 'M'=Mandarin, 'V'=Vietnamese, 'SA'=South Asian
:block_name = 'Morning'  -- Optional: filter by block name
```

### **Management Day-Part Summary**
```sql
-- Generates "Morning Chinese", "Vietnamese Afternoon" labels automatically
-- Parameters: :start_date, :end_date, :language_code (optional)
```

### **Grid Comparison Report**
```sql
-- Compare Standard Grid vs Dallas Grid performance
-- Parameters: :start_date, :end_date
```

### **Sample JSON Output Structure**
Your HTML team will receive JSON like this:
```json
{
  "daypart_performance": [
    {
      "management_label": "Morning Chinese",
      "total_revenue": 325000.00,
      "language_targeted_revenue": 245000.00,
      "language_targeting_percentage": 75.4,
      "unique_customers": 42
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Business Rules Implemented**

### **1. No Import Blocking**
- Spots **always import successfully**, even without grid coverage
- System **alerts but never blocks** import process
- Unassigned spots flagged for manual review

### **2. Collision Prevention**
- **Automatic detection** of overlapping schedule assignments
- **Guardrails prevent** conflicting market assignments
- **Alert system** for resolution workflow

### **3. Historical Preservation**
- Spots **locked to original grid version** when assigned
- Schedule changes **don't affect historical spots**
- **Complete audit trail** of all assignments

### **4. Customer Intent Classification**
- **Language Specific**: Spot falls within single language block
- **Time Specific**: Spans multiple blocks, same day-part  
- **Customer Indifferent**: Spans multiple language blocks
- **No Grid Coverage**: Market has no assigned programming grid

# Language Block Programming Schedule Implementation Spec - INCLUSION MODEL

## Overview
Implement a market-inclusion based language block programming schedule system. Markets explicitly belong to specific grids rather than being excluded from others. This creates a cleaner, more scalable architecture.

## Key Architectural Changes
- **Positive Assignment Model**: Markets belong to grids (not excluded from them)
- **Multiple Grid Support**: Standard Grid, Dallas Grid, future Holiday/Seasonal grids
- **Market-Schedule Mapping**: Explicit assignments with effective dates
- **Grid Coverage Monitoring**: Track which markets have grid coverage

## Phase 1: Database Schema Implementation - INCLUSION MODEL

### 1.1 Create Core Tables
Execute the revised SQL schema to create:
- `programming_schedules` - Different grids (Standard, Dallas, Holiday, etc.)
- `schedule_market_assignments` - Which markets belong to which grids
- `language_blocks` - Time ranges within each grid
- `spot_language_blocks` - Spot assignments with grid coverage status

### 1.2 Initial Grid Setup
```sql
-- Standard Grid for most markets
INSERT INTO programming_schedules (schedule_name, schedule_version, schedule_type, ...)

-- Assign markets to Standard Grid
INSERT INTO schedule_market_assignments (schedule_id, market_id, ...)
SELECT 1, market_id FROM markets WHERE market_code IN ('NYC', 'SFO', 'CVC', 'HOU', 'LAX', 'SEA', 'CMP')

-- Dallas Grid (placeholder for future definition)
INSERT INTO programming_schedules (schedule_name='Dallas Grid', schedule_type='market_specific', ...)

-- Assign Dallas to its own grid  
INSERT INTO schedule_market_assignments (schedule_id, market_id, ...)
SELECT 2, market_id FROM markets WHERE market_code = 'DAL'
```

### 1.3 Grid Coverage Validation
New validation capabilities:
- Which markets have grid assignments
- Which markets lack coverage
- Grid assignment conflicts or gaps

## Phase 2: Enhanced System with Collision Detection

### 2.1 Collision Detection Service - NEW
File: `src/services/schedule_collision_service.py`

```python
class ScheduleCollisionService(BaseService):
    """Handles detection and resolution of schedule conflicts."""
    
    def validate_new_schedule_assignment(self, market_id: int, schedule_id: int,
                                       start_date: date, end_date: date = None) -> ValidationResult:
        """
        Validate that a new schedule assignment won't create conflicts.
        
        Returns:
            ValidationResult with collision details if conflicts found
        """
        
    def detect_market_overlaps(self, market_id: int) -> List[CollisionInfo]:
        """Find all overlapping schedule assignments for a market."""
        
    def resolve_collision(self, collision_id: int, resolution_method: str,
                         resolved_by: str, notes: str = None) -> bool:
        """
        Resolve a detected collision.
        
        resolution_method: 'adjust_dates', 'change_priority', 'manual_override'
        """
        
    def get_unresolved_collisions(self) -> List[CollisionInfo]:
        """Get all unresolved schedule collisions."""
        
    def prevent_schedule_gaps(self, market_id: int) -> List[DateGapInfo]:
        """Detect gaps in schedule coverage for a market."""
```

### 2.2 Enhanced Import Process - NO BLOCKING BUT ALERT
Update `BroadcastMonthImportService`:

```python
def _import_excel_data(self, excel_file: str, batch_id: str, conn) -> int:
    # ... existing import logic ...
    
    # After importing spots, assign language blocks
    print("üéØ Assigning language blocks to imported spots...")
    
    # Get spots from this batch
    cursor = conn.execute(
        "SELECT spot_id FROM spots WHERE import_batch_id = ?", 
        (batch_id,)
    )
    spot_ids = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    
    # Assign language blocks (will automatically handle grid coverage)
    assignment_results = self.language_block_service.assign_spots_to_blocks(spot_ids)
    
    # ALERT USER BUT DON'T BLOCK IMPORT
    if assignment_results.get('no_grid_coverage', 0) > 0:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  ALERT: {assignment_results['no_grid_coverage']} spots have no grid coverage")
        print(f"    These spots were imported but cannot be assigned to language blocks")
        print(f"    Consider defining language blocks for their markets")
    
    if assignment_results.get('grid_not_defined', 0) > 0:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  ALERT: {assignment_results['grid_not_defined']} spots have grid assignments but no language blocks defined")
        print(f"    These spots need language block definitions for their assigned grids")
    
    print(f"Language block assignments: {assignment_results}")
    
    return imported_count
```

### 2.3 Dallas Grid Population - LANGUAGE BLOCK APPROACH
File: `src/scripts/populate_dallas_grid.py`

```python
class DallasGridPopulator:
    """Populates the Dallas programming grid with language blocks (no program titles)."""
    
    def __init__(self, db_connection: DatabaseConnection):
        self.db = db_connection
        self.schedule_id = 2  # Dallas Grid schedule ID
    
    def populate_dallas_language_blocks(self):

## Phase 3: Collision Detection and Prevention

### 3.1 Schedule Validation CLI
File: `src/cli/validate_schedules.py`

```bash
# Detect all schedule collisions
python src/cli/validate_schedules.py --detect-collisions

# Validate specific market assignment before creating it
python src/cli/validate_schedules.py --validate-assignment \
  --market "NYC" --schedule-id 3 --start-date "2025-12-01" --end-date "2025-12-31"

# Check for schedule gaps
python src/cli/validate_schedules.py --check-gaps --market "NYC"

# Resolve collision
python src/cli/validate_schedules.py --resolve-collision \
  --collision-id 123 --method "adjust_dates" --resolved-by "Kurt"
```

### 3.2 Collision Prevention Triggers
The database schema includes triggers that automatically detect:
- **Market Assignment Overlaps**: Same market assigned to multiple grids for overlapping periods
- **Schedule Date Conflicts**: New schedules with conflicting effective dates
- **Grid Coverage Gaps**: Markets without schedule coverage

### 3.3 Sample Collision Scenarios and Prevention

**Scenario 1: Holiday Programming Overlap**
```sql
-- This would trigger a collision detection
INSERT INTO schedule_market_assignments (
    schedule_id, market_id, effective_start_date, effective_end_date
) VALUES (
    3, -- Holiday Grid
    1, -- NYC market  
    '2025-12-01', 
    '2025-12-31'
);
-- Collision detected: NYC already assigned to Standard Grid with no end date
```

**Scenario 2: Schedule Transition Validation**
```python
# Before transitioning NYC to Holiday Grid:
collision_service = ScheduleCollisionService(db_connection)
validation = collision_service.validate_new_schedule_assignment(
    market_id=1, schedule_id=3, 
    start_date=date(2025, 12, 1), end_date=date(2025, 12, 31)
)

if not validation.is_valid:
    print(f"Collision detected: {validation.error_message}")
    print(f"Suggested resolution: {validation.suggested_action}")
    # Handle collision before proceeding
```

## Phase 4: Enhanced Reporting System

2. **`market_grid_coverage`** - Operational monitoring of grid assignments

### 4.2 Grid-Aware Reports
File: `src/cli/generate_language_block_reports.py`

```bash
# Revenue by grid
python src/cli/generate_language_block_reports.py --type grid_revenue --month 2025-01

# Standard Grid performance only
python src/cli/generate_language_block_reports.py --type daypart_revenue \

## Phase 6: Future Grid Expansion

### 6.1 Adding Dallas Grid
When ready to define Dallas programming:

```bash
# Define Dallas language blocks
python src/cli/manage_programming_grids.py --define-blocks \
  --grid-id 2 --schedule-file "data/dallas_programming_schedule.csv"

# Reassign Dallas spots to use new blocks
python src/scripts/reassign_market_spots.py --market "DAL" --grid-id 2
```

### 6.2 Seasonal/Holiday Grids
```bash
# Create holiday grid
python src/cli/manage_programming_grids.py --create-grid \
  --name "Holiday Grid" --type "seasonal" \
  --start-date "2025-12-01" --end-date "2025-12-31"

# Temporarily move markets to holiday grid
python src/cli/manage_programming_grids.py --assign-markets \
  --grid-id 3 --markets "NYC,SFO,LAX" \
  --start-date "2025-12-01" --end-date "2025-12-31"
```

## Testing Strategy - INCLUSION MODEL

### Unit Tests
- `test_grid_resolver_service.py`: Market-to-grid resolution
- `test_market_assignment_logic.py`: Grid assignment validation
- `test_multi_grid_scenarios.py`: Multiple grids with same markets
- `test_coverage_validation.py`: Grid coverage checking

### Integration Tests
- Grid assignment workflow end-to-end
- Market transition between grids
- Historical preservation during grid changes
- Reporting accuracy across multiple grids

### Data Validation Tests
```python
# Validate all markets have grid assignments
def test_all_markets_have_grid_coverage():
    uncovered = service.get_markets_without_grid_coverage(date.today())
    assert len(uncovered) == 0, f"Markets without coverage: {uncovered}"

# Validate no conflicting assignments
def test_no_conflicting_grid_assignments():
    conflicts = service.validate_grid_coverage().conflicts
    assert len(conflicts) == 0, f"Conflicting assignments: {conflicts}"

# Validate Dallas has separate grid
def test_dallas_separate_grid():
    dal_grid = service.get_grid_for_market('DAL', date.today())
    standard_markets = service.get_markets_for_grid('Standard Grid')
    assert 'DAL' not in standard_markets
    assert dal_grid.schedule_name == 'Dallas Grid'
```

## Success Metrics - INCLUSION MODEL

### Architecture Quality
- **Clean Separation**: Each market belongs to exactly one grid
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new grids (Regional, Seasonal, etc.)
- **Maintainability**: Clear market-to-grid relationships
- **Auditability**: Complete assignment history

### Operational Metrics
- **Coverage**: 100% of markets have grid assignments
- **Consistency**: No conflicting or overlapping assignments
- **Performance**: Grid resolution <50ms for any market/date
- **Flexibility**: Easy grid transitions for markets

### Business Value
- **Grid Comparison**: Compare Standard vs Dallas performance
- **Market Analysis**: Revenue by grid type
- **Programming Optimization**: Grid-specific scheduling decisions
- **Expansion Planning**: Framework for new market additions

## Risk Mitigation - INCLUSION MODEL

### Grid Assignment Risks
- **Validation**: Automated checks for assignment gaps
- **Monitoring**: Alerts for uncovered markets
- **Recovery**: Tools to quickly assign markets to grids

### Data Integrity Risks
- **Historical Preservation**: Assignments locked to specific schedule versions
- **Transition Safety**: Validation before market transitions
- **Rollback Capability**: Undo grid changes if needed

## Key Deliverables - INCLUSION MODEL

### Core Architecture
- [ ] Market-to-grid assignment system
- [ ] Grid resolver service with caching
- [ ] Coverage validation and monitoring
- [ ] Historical assignment preservation

### Management Tools
- [ ] Grid creation and management CLI
- [ ] Market assignment tools
- [ ] Coverage validation reports
- [ ] Grid transition utilities

### Reporting Capabilities
- [ ] Grid-aware revenue analysis
- [ ] Market coverage monitoring
- [ ] Cross-grid performance comparison
- [ ] Assignment history tracking

This inclusion-based model provides:
1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Markets explicitly belong to grids
2. **Better Scalability**: Easy to add new grids for different purposes
3. **Operational Clarity**: Clear ownership and coverage tracking  
4. **Future Flexibility**: Framework for seasonal, regional, or special event grids

The system now thinks in terms of "Which markets belong to the Standard Grid?" rather than "Which markets are excluded from analysis?" This is much more maintainable and extensible.
