# Enhanced Business Rules Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the deployment of the **Enhanced Business Rules System** - an additive layer that improves language block assignments by recognizing master control operational patterns while preserving all existing functionality.

## System Architecture

### Additive Design Philosophy
- **Preserves existing logic**: All current assignments remain unchanged
- **Only applies when base logic returns 'indifferent'**: Enhanced rules are a refinement layer
- **Grid-dependent**: Rules are tied to current programming grid configuration
- **Fully tracked**: All enhanced assignments are auditable and reversible

### Enhanced Business Rules

| Rule | Pattern | Language Hint | Action | Campaign Type |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|---------------|
| **Tagalog Pattern** | 16:00-19:00 | "T" | → Tagalog Block | language_specific |
| **Chinese Pattern** | 19:00-23:59 | "M" or "M/C" | → Chinese Block | language_specific |
| **ROS Duration** | > 4 hours | Any | → ROS | ros |
| **ROS Time** | 13:00-23:59 | Any | → ROS | ros |

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Run migration (dry run first)
python enhanced_rules_migration.py --database data/database/production.db --dry-run

# Apply migration  
python enhanced_rules_migration.py --database data/database/production.db

# Verify migration
python enhanced_rules_migration.py --database data/database/production.db --verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Added business_rule_applied column
✅ Added auto_resolved_date column  
✅ Created index idx_spot_blocks_business_rule
✅ Created index idx_spot_blocks_auto_resolved
✅ Created view enhanced_rule_analytics
✅ Created view business_rule_summary
```

### Step 2: Update Language Block Service

Replace the existing `LanguageBlockService` class in `cli_01_assign_language_blocks.py` with the enhanced version:

```python
# Key changes in existing code:
# 1. Updated AssignmentResult dataclass (added business_rule_applied, auto_resolved_date)
# 2. Modified _create_assignment() to call enhanced rules
# 3. Updated _save_assignment() to handle new fields
# 4. Added enhanced rule methods (_apply_enhanced_business_rules, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Test Enhanced Rules

```bash
# Create test data
python enhanced_rules_testing.py --database data/database/production.db --create-test-data

# Run tests
python enhanced_rules_testing.py --database data/database/production.db

# Clean up test data
python enhanced_rules_testing.py --database data/database/production.db --cleanup
```

**Expected Test Results:**
```
✅ Enhanced rule assignments:
   • TEST_TAGALOG_PATTERN: ✅ Enhanced: tagalog_pattern
   • TEST_CHINESE_PATTERN: ✅ Enhanced: chinese_pattern
   • TEST_ROS_DURATION: ✅ Enhanced: ros_duration
   • TEST_ROS_TIME: ✅ Enhanced: ros_time
   • TEST_NO_PATTERN: ⚠️ Standard: indifferent
   • TEST_CHINESE_WRONG_HINT: ⚠️ Standard: indifferent
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Test assignment with enhanced rules
python cli_01_assign_language_blocks.py --test 100

# Assign batch with enhanced rules
python cli_01_assign_language_blocks.py --batch 1000

# Full year assignment with enhanced rules
python cli_01_assign_language_blocks.py --all-year 2024
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Enhanced Rule Statistics

```bash
# View production statistics
python enhanced_rules_testing.py --database data/database/production.db --stats
```

### Database Analytics

```sql
-- Enhanced rule breakdown
SELECT * FROM enhanced_rule_analytics;

-- Business rule summary
SELECT * FROM business_rule_summary;

-- Recent enhanced assignments
SELECT 
    s.bill_code,
    s.time_in,
    s.time_out,
    s.language_code,
    slb.business_rule_applied,
    slb.auto_resolved_date
FROM spots s
JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE slb.business_rule_applied IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY slb.auto_resolved_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Business Rule Details

### Rule 1: Tagalog Pattern Recognition
**Business Case**: Master control runs Tagalog spots 16:00-19:00 all week, manually blocking around weekend Hmong programming.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Pattern**: `time_in = "16:00:00" AND time_out = "19:00:00"`
- **Language Hint**: `language_code = "T"`
- **Action**: Assign to Tagalog language block
- **Result**: `customer_intent = "language_specific"`, `business_rule_applied = "tagalog_pattern"`

### Rule 2: Chinese Pattern Recognition
**Business Case**: Chinese spots 19:00-23:59 target both Mandarin and Cantonese audiences.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Pattern**: `time_in = "19:00:00" AND time_out = "23:59:00"`
- **Language Hint**: `language_code IN ("M", "M/C")`
- **Action**: Assign to Chinese family block (prefers Mandarin)
- **Result**: `customer_intent = "language_specific"`, `business_rule_applied = "chinese_pattern"`

### Rule 3: ROS Duration Detection
**Business Case**: Spots running > 4 hours are ROS placements, not language-specific.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Pattern**: `duration > 240 minutes`
- **Language Hint**: Any
- **Action**: Assign as ROS
- **Result**: `customer_intent = "indifferent"`, `campaign_type = "ros"`, `business_rule_applied = "ros_duration"`

### Rule 4: ROS Time Detection
**Business Case**: 13:00-23:59 time slot indicates ROS placement.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Pattern**: `time_in = "13:00:00" AND time_out = "23:59:00"`
- **Language Hint**: Any
- **Action**: Assign as ROS
- **Result**: `customer_intent = "indifferent"`, `campaign_type = "ros"`, `business_rule_applied = "ros_time"`

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Automated Validation
The system includes built-in validation:
- **Pattern matching accuracy**: Exact time and language hint matching
- **Rule precedence**: Duration and time rules checked before language patterns
- **Fallback behavior**: If no enhanced rule applies, returns original assignment

### Manual Validation
Recommended periodic checks:
1. **Sample enhanced assignments**: Review `business_rule_applied` assignments
2. **Language hint accuracy**: Verify language hints match advertiser intent
3. **Grid dependency**: Re-evaluate rules when programming grid changes

### Rollback Procedure
Enhanced rules can be disabled without data loss:
1. **Identify enhanced assignments**: `WHERE business_rule_applied IS NOT NULL`
2. **Revert to base logic**: Re-run assignment with enhanced rules disabled
3. **Clear tracking fields**: `UPDATE spot_language_blocks SET business_rule_applied = NULL`

## Performance Impact

### Database Performance
- **Minimal overhead**: Only 2 additional columns per assignment
- **Optimized queries**: Indexes on `business_rule_applied` and `auto_resolved_date`
- **No impact on existing queries**: All existing functionality preserved

### Assignment Performance
- **Additive only**: Enhanced rules only execute when base logic returns 'indifferent'
- **Early termination**: Rules are checked in order of efficiency
- **Cached language hints**: Language code retrieved once per spot

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Revenue Analysis
Enhanced rules work seamlessly with existing revenue analysis:
- **Unified Analysis**: Enhanced assignments integrate with category analysis
- **Multi-language Export**: Enhanced assignments properly excluded from multi-language exports
- **Reconciliation**: Perfect reconciliation maintained

### Reporting
Enhanced rule assignments appear in existing reports:
- **Language Block Revenue**: Enhanced assignments contribute to language block revenue
- **Customer Intent**: Enhanced assignments show as `language_specific` or `indifferent`
- **Campaign Type**: Enhanced assignments show as `language_specific` or `ros`

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Enhanced rule application rate**: Target 5-10% of previously 'indifferent' assignments
- **Pattern matching accuracy**: >95% correct pattern recognition
- **Performance impact**: <5% increase in assignment processing time

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Master control alignment**: Enhanced assignments match operational reality
- **Advertiser intent accuracy**: Language hints properly validate assignments
- **Grid dependency**: Rules automatically adapt to programming grid changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Enhanced rules not applying"
**Cause**: Base logic not returning 'indifferent'  
**Solution**: Enhanced rules only apply to spots with multiple different language blocks

#### "Wrong language hint"
**Cause**: Original spreadsheet language column inaccurate  
**Solution**: Language hints are suggestive only - patterns must match

#### "Pattern not matching"
**Cause**: Exact time matching required  
**Solution**: Verify time format is exactly "HH:MM:SS"

#### "Chinese assignment incorrect"
**Cause**: Multiple Chinese blocks available  
**Solution**: System prefers Mandarin (language_id=2) over Cantonese (language_id=3)

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check enhanced rule candidates
SELECT s.spot_id, s.bill_code, s.time_in, s.time_out, s.language_code
FROM spots s
JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE slb.customer_intent = 'indifferent'
AND slb.business_rule_applied IS NULL
ORDER BY s.time_in, s.time_out;

-- Verify pattern matching
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as tagalog_candidates
FROM spots s
JOIN spot_language_blocks slb ON s.spot_id = slb.spot_id
WHERE s.time_in = '16:00:00' 
AND s.time_out = '19:00:00'
AND s.language_code = 'T'
AND slb.customer_intent = 'indifferent';
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Extensions
1. **Additional language patterns**: Vietnamese, Korean patterns as programming grid evolves
2. **Confidence scoring**: Machine learning confidence for pattern matching
3. **Dynamic rule management**: UI for business users to modify rules
4. **A/B testing framework**: Compare enhanced vs. standard assignments

### Grid Change Management
When programming grid changes:
1. **Review patterns**: Verify time patterns still match grid
2. **Update rules**: Modify patterns to match new grid configuration
3. **Re-assign affected spots**: Apply new rules to existing assignments
4. **Document changes**: Track grid-dependent rule modifications
