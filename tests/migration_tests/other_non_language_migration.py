Other Non-Language Revenue Migration
===================================

This implements the Other Non-Language revenue category using BaseQueryBuilder.
Expected result: ~$58,733.77 according to your guide.

This category includes:
- No language assignment (slb.spot_id IS NULL)
- Not PRD/SVC spot types (regular spots)
- Excludes WorldLink
- Excludes NKB (they go to Overnight Shopping)
- Miscellaneous spots requiring investigation
